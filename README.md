link of the app : https://student-adaptability-app-ghazi.streamlit.app

This application uses machine learning to predict how well students can adapt to online education based on factors like age, education level, financial situation, and more.
I used a dataset from kaggle to build the classification model that predicts the adaptivity level . 
Key features include:
- A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- Real-time predictions of adaptability levels
- Useful data visualizations
